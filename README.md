##Why Athena?

The title of my project is Athena, which is a tribute to the Greek goddess of wisdom.
This name is used to celebrate the process of learning and sharing knowledge.
In this current era of technology and short attention span, learning has become quiet a difficult process.
The traditional way of learning from books seems pretty far-fetch now. To tackle this particular problem,
I cooked up an idea in my fantasy filled brain and tried to give it a shape.
The result of that effort is my project, Athena.
This application is build to promote self learning in a creative way and to make little children more interested in the world of learning.
